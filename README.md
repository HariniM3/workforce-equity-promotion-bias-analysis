Workforce Equity & Promotion Bias Analysis

This project explores gender-based differences in pay, career progression, leadership representation, and attrition using employee workforce data. The goal was to go beyond surface-level averages and understand how equity outcomes change across job roles, seniority levels, and promotion stages.

The analysis focuses on identifying structural patterns that affect how employees progress within an organization, rather than only looking at overall headcount or salary differences.

Gender pay differences after accounting for job role and seniority

Representation of women and men across leadership levels

Promotion patterns, including likelihood of promotion and time between promotions

Attrition risk by gender and job level

Relationship between compensation and employee exits

Tools used

SQL (MySQL) for data validation, segmentation, and analytical queries
